## Introduction

Algorithmic trading involves using automated systems to make trading decisions. This project focuses on predicting BTC-USD price movements and implementing a trading strategy using an LSTM-based model. The model is trained on historical market data and tested through backtesting to evaluate its performance.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations on arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for train-test split and data preprocessing.
- **Keras (with TensorFlow backend)**: Building and training the LSTM model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing includes historical BTC-USD market data, such as open, high, low, close prices, and volume.

## Implementation

### Data Preprocessing

The raw dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize the data. The training and testing sets are split, and a sequence of data points is created for input to the LSTM model.

### LSTM Model Architecture

The LSTM model architecture comprises multiple layers of LSTM cells with dropout for regularization. The model is designed to learn from historical patterns in the data.

### Training

The model is trained using the training set, and the training process is optimized using the Adam optimizer. The number of epochs and batch size are configurable parameters.

### Backtesting

The trained model is backtested on historical data to simulate its performance in a real trading scenario. Buy/sell signals are generated based on predicted price changes, and the portfolio value is calculated.

## Results and Metrics

The project evaluates the model's performance using various metrics, including gross profit, net profit, win rate, max drawdown, and more.
